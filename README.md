* The file `local-xdebuginfo.php` is utilized by LocalWP; should you choose to utilize alternative development environments, you have the option to remove it.

* You have the option to compress the `wp-content/` directory instead of directly committing the files and folders to Git by executing the command `php zip.php`.

* You have the option to utilize the command `composer lint` to assess WordPress code violations within your themes and/or plugins. Please review the `phpcs.xml.dist` file to specify exclusions for themes or plugins that should not undergo scrutiny.
